# ML_Health_Project

End-to-End Machine Learning Project on Health Data

This repository contains a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning project focused on real-world health data. It covers the entire pipeline from data ingestion and preprocessing to exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and deployment.

The goal is to build a robust and reproducible ML workflow that addresses real health-related problems while emphasizing best practices in data science and machine learning.

Key components include:

📥 Data collection and cleaning

📊 Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

🏗️ Feature engineering and selection

🤖 Model training, tuning, and validation (with ML and potentially deep learning models)

📈 Model evaluation using appropriate metrics for health data

🚀 Deployment-ready pipeline with reproducibility in mind

📁 Clear project structure and documentation

This project can serve as a template or reference for building scalable ML solutions in healthcare and related fields.
